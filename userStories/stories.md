AddBook

I want a user to be able to add a book.

What will we need for a user to add a bokk?

    Data:
        Book title
        Book author
        Book genre

What do we need before a user can add a book?

    Data:
        Author
        Genre

Add author

I want a user to be able to add an author

    Data:
        authorName

    User will add through a form with an input field and a button.

Message Change

I want the user to see the header message change on interaction with the app/data change

     e.g. When an author is added to the db, the message will change to "You added the auhtor [authorName]"
